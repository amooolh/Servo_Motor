# Running a Servo Motor Using Arduino

# Tools :
- servo motor
- Arduino board
- Wires

# Delivery steps:
- The black wire in the motor is connected to the GND on the Arduino board, the red wire to 5V, and the yellow wire to one of the pens (select pin 9).
- Then the servo motor can be started using the sweep code (found in the servo-sweep file examples).

# Connecting four servo motors together

# Tools :
- 4 servo motors
- Arduino board
- Wires
- breadboard
- power supply (5V)

# Delivery steps:
All black motors wires are connected to the negative terminal of the breadboard, the red wires are to the positive terminal of the breadboard, and the yellow wires are connected to each wire with a pen on the Arduino board (selected 8-9-10-11), a wire is connected between the Arduino board in GND and breadboard on the negative terminal, and finally connect the power supply to the breadboard.
